# Software-Development-Lifecycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software applications. It consists of several distinct phases, each with specific activities and deliverables. 



**Planning**: 

Define the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. This phase involves gathering requirements and creating a project plan.

**Analysis**: 

Analyze the requirements in detail to understand what the software needs to achieve. This phase often includes creating detailed specifications.

**Design**:

Develop the architecture and design of the software. This includes defining the system components, interfaces, and data flow.

**Implementation**: 

Write the actual code based on the design specifications. This is where the software is built.

**Testing**: 

Test the software to identify and fix any bugs or issues. This phase ensures the software meets the required standards and functions correctly.

**Deployment**: 

Release the software to users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training.

**Maintenance**:

Provide ongoing support and updates to the software. This includes fixing any issues that arise and making improvements.

# Purpose Of Using SDLC

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used for developing software applications. Here are some key reasons why SDLC is important

1. **Structured Approach**:
    SDLC provides a clear framework that helps in planning, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software efficiently.
   
3. **Improved Quality**:
   By following a systematic process, the quality of the software is enhanced, reducing the chances of errors and bugs.
   
5. **Cost Management**:
   It helps in managing costs by identifying potential issues early in the development process, which can save time and resources.
   
7. **Better Project Management**:
    SDLC allows for better project management by defining clear stages and deliverables, making it easier to track progress and meet deadlines.
   
9. **Customer Satisfaction**:
    By involving stakeholders throughout the process, SDLC ensures that the final product meets the user's requirements and expectations.
