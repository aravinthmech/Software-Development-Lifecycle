# Software-Development-Lifecycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software applications. It consists of several distinct phases, each with specific activities and deliverables. Here's a brief overview of the main phases:

Planning: Define the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. This phase involves gathering requirements and creating a project plan.
Analysis: Analyze the requirements in detail to understand what the software needs to achieve. This phase often includes creating detailed specifications.
Design: Develop the architecture and design of the software. This includes defining the system components, interfaces, and data flow.
Implementation (or Coding): Write the actual code based on the design specifications. This is where the software is built.
Testing: Test the software to identify and fix any bugs or issues. This phase ensures the software meets the required standards and functions correctly.
Deployment: Release the software to users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training.
Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates to the software. This includes fixing any issues that arise and making improvements.
