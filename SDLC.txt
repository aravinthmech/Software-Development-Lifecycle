Software Developement Life Cycle

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used for developing software applications.
It consists of several distinct phases, each with specific activities and deliverables. Here's a brief overview of the main phases:

1. **Planning**: Define the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. 
2. **Analysis**: Analyze the requirements in detail to understand what the software needs to achieve. 
3. **Design**: Develop the architecture and design of the software.
4. **Implementation (or Coding)**: Write the actual code based on the design specifications. 
5. **Testing**: Test the software to identify and fix any bugs or issues. 
6. **Deployment**: Release the software to users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training.
7. **Maintenance**: Provide ongoing support and updates to the software. This includes fixing any issues that arise and making improvements.
